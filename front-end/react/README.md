# React

## Some basic principles

According to the [React doc](https://reactjs.org/docs)

- React components are immutable. Once an element is created, its children or attributes cannot be changed.
- All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
- For stateful components (in Flutter terms), state changes must be done with a `this.setState` call. (just like Flutter)
